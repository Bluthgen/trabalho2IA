Multiobjective Investment Policy for a Nonlinear Stochastic Financial System: A Fuzzy Approach
Chien-Feng Wu, Bor-Sen Chen, Life Fellow, IEEE, and Weihai Zhang, Senior Member, IEEE

Abstract--The financial market always suffers from continuous and discontinuous (jump) changes and can be regarded as a nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion system. Most investors expect their investment policies to be not only higher benefits but also lower risk as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP). In this study, a multiobjective H2 /H fuzzy investment is proposed for nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial systems to achieve the desired target with minimum investment cost and risk in Pareto optimal sense, simultaneously. The Takagi­Sugeno (T­S) fuzzy model is used to approximate the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system to simplify the multiobjective H2 /H investment policy design procedure. By the help of the T­S fuzzy model, the multiobjective H2 /H fuzzy investment policy problem of nonlinear stochastic financial system can be transformed to a linear-matrix-inequality-constrained (LMI-constrained) MOP to avoid solving the annoying Hamilton­Jacobi inequalities. Because the LMI-constrained MOP is not easy to directly calculate its Pareto optimal solutions, an indirect method is proposed to solve this MOP for the multiobjective H2 /H fuzzy investment policy design of nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial systems. An LMI-constrained multiobjective evolution algorithm (LMI-constrained MOEA) is also developed to efficiently solve the Pareto optimal solutions of the LMI-constrained MOP for the multiobjective H2 /H fuzzy investment policy design of nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial systems. When the Pareto optimal regulation solutions are solved by the proposed LMI-constrained MOEA, investors can select one investment policy to achieve their desired target with minimum investment cost and risk according to his/her own preference.

economic problems become more and more complicated today.
Different types of mathematical model for the financial systems
have been widely studied. In recent years, researchers focus
on the system dynamical model to describe the real economic

and financial systems [1]­[5]. However, in practical cases, the financial dynamic system is a nonlinear stochastic system and may suffer from continuous and discontinuous parametric fluctuations due to national and international situation change, oil price change, the surplus between investment and savings, the variable of interest rate, false economy policy, etc. Thus, using a nonlinear stochastic dynamical model to describe a real financial system would be more appealing [6]­[9]. The stochastic parametric fluctuations can be decomposed as continuous state-dependent fluctuations and discontinuous (jump) statedependent fluctuations. Both of them will influence the stability of the stochastic financial dynamical system. Moreover, the external investment disturbance due to the unpredictable investment-environmental changes or a worldwide event, such as war, natural disaster, fatal epidemic disease, etc., can also affect the fluctuations of financial system. Thus, in this study, a nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion system with internal random fluctuation and external disturbance is employed to describe a nonlinear stochastic financial system.
Managers and investors always expect their investment policies to be with not only higher return on investment (ROI) but also lower risk. Because the ROI and lower investment risks normally conflict with each other, investment policy can be regarded as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP). Thus, the multiobjective investment policies appear naturally and are also widely applied in financial systems [10]. For a financial system, the multiobjective H2/H investment policy design for the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system can be seen as how to search a management policy to maximize ROI (H2 management policy) and minimize investment risk (H management policy), simultaneously.
Robust regulation control is to design a state feedback controller to ensure that the trajectories of the controlled system gradually converge to some desired trajectories (target) despite intrinsic noise and extrinsic disturbance [11], [19], [24], [25], [33]. It is particularly appropriate to be employed in financial system. The most two important topics of robust optimal regulation control are how to minimize the regulation error to achieve the desired target despite intrinsic fluctuation and how to increase the system robustness to reject the effect due to environmental disturbance. The optimal H2 management policy is proposed to minimize the regulation error to achieve the desired reference target despite intrinsic fluctuation [13]­[15]. The robust H management policy is introduced to reduce the effects of external disturbances on the regulation performance. For a financial system, the H2 optimal regulation control can be regarded as how to design an investment policy to ensure

that the financial system can gradually converge to the expectant trajectories of managers or investors and minimize the investment cost, i.e., a higher ROI policy. On the other hand, the robust H regulation control for a financial system can be seen as how to design a manageable policy to minimize the investment risk due to intrinsic continuous and discontinuous random fluctuations and external disturbance. However, both of optimal H2 and robust H management policy need to solve a difficult Hamilton-Jacobi inequality (HJI) (a second-order nonlinear partial differential equation) to achieve a desired steady state (target) of nonlinear stochastic financial system. To overcome this difficult problem, i.e., solving HJI, the Takagi­Sugeno (T­S) fuzzy model is employed to simplify the multiobjective H2 /H investment policy problem of nonlinear stochastic financial systems in this study.
Recently, the T­S fuzzy model has been widely used to efficiently approximate nonlinear systems [17]­[20], and a T­S fuzzy controller has also been successfully applied to the stabilization control design for nonlinear system. To avoid solving the annoying HJIs, the T­S fuzzy model is employed to approximate the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system by interpolating several local linear stochastic jump diffusion financial systems at different operation points. When a nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system was represented by an interpolation of a set of linear stochastic jump diffusion financial systems, a T­S fuzzy model-based regulation method can also be developed to achieve the multiobjective H2 /H investment policy. Thus, the HJIs can be replaced by a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). These LMIs can be efficiently solved by a convex optimization method to complete the multiobjective H2 /H fuzzy investment policy design. Therefore, the multiobjective H2 /H investment policy problem of the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system becomes to how to solve an LMI-constrained MOP.
Although a number of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been discussed for their ability to efficiently search the Pareto optimal solutions of MOP in a single run [27]­ [30], [32], [41], most of them focus on the multiobjective problem with algebraic functional systems or algebraic constraints. Few of these studies discuss the system dynamical constrained MOP for the nonlinear stochastic financial system, in which robust stability must be guaranteed beforehand. More effort is still needed to apply the MOEA to solve the MOP for multiobjective H2/H investment policy of nonlinear stochastic financial systems. Based on the T­S fuzzy model, the multiobjective H2 /H investment policy problem of the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system can be transformed to an LMI-constrained MOP. In general, there exists no unique solution for LMI-constrained MOP. The multiple solutions of MOP are called Pareto optimal solutions. To efficiently solve the multiobjective H2 /H investment policy problem of the nonlinear financial system, an indirect method is introduced to help us approach the Pareto optimal solutions at the Pareto front of the LMI-constrained MOP by gradually decreasing the upper bound of H2 and H performance indices, i.e., nondominating searching scheme is employed to find Pareto front for Pareto optimal solutions of management policy without violating the stability of nonlinear stochastic system, simultaneously.

The proposed LMI-constrained MOEA combines the LMI

technique with MOEA together to solve the LMI-constrained

MOP for multiobjective H2 /H investment policy of non-

linear stochastic jump diffusion financial systems. The LMI-

constrained MOEA search algorithm via a number of genetic

operation, e.g., selection, mutation, and crossover, is proposed

with the help of LMI toolbox in MATLAB to efficiently search

for Pareto front of Pareto optimal solutions and its corresponding

fuzzy regulation gains {Ki} from the LMI constraints to meet

the robust stability and multiobjective H2/H policy optimiza-

simultaneously. As long as the Pareto front can be obtained, the

multiobjective H2/H investment policy problem for a non-

linear stochastic jump diffusion financial system can also be

solved, and the manager(or investor) can select a mutual benefit

policy according to his/her own preference.

II. PRELIMINARIES

In [1] and [5], a financial dynamical model is given to illustrate

the interaction between interesting rate, x, investment demand,

  x (t) = z(t) + (y(t) - a) x(t)

where the parameters a  0 is the saving amount, b  0 is the per-investment cost, and c  0 is the elasticity of demands of commercials. In the nonlinear financial model (1), the interest rate x(t) can be influenced by the surplus between investment and saving as well as adjustments of the prices. The investment demand y(t) is proportional to the rate of investment and inversely proportional to the cost of investment and the interest rate. The price index z(t) depends on the difference between supply and demand in the market, and it is also influenced by the inflation rate.
However, in practice, most financial systems are stochastic systems, and the dynamical model in (1) may suffer from parametric fluctuations due to the surplus between investment and savings, oil price, or government policy changes. To mimic the real financial system, the dynamical model in (1) should be modified by continuous and discontinuous intrinsic random

Thus, the stochastic nonlinear autonomous controlled system for the financial system in (2) can be written as follows (see system diagram in Fig. 1):

Fig. 1. System diagram for the multiobjective investment policy problem of
the nonlinear financial system. The nonlinear stochastic system in (3) is to be controlled to achieve the desired steady state xd by the multiobjective H2 /H regulator. In order to achieve the desired steady state xd , the original nonlinear stochastic financial system in (3) is shifted to xd so that the regulation problem to xd becomes a stabilization problem of the nonlinear stochastic system in (5). When the shifted stochastic financial system in (5) is completely approximated
by the T­S fuzzy model, the multiobjective H2 /H investment policy problem in (18) can be regarded as an LMI-constrained MOP in (20) by employing the
proposed indirect method in Lemma 2. Since the LMI-constrained MOP in (20)
is difficult to solve by directly calculating, we proposed the LMI-constrained
MOEA to efficiently solve the LMI-constrained MOP in (20). Thus, the multiob-
jective H2 /H investment policy problem for a nonlinear stochastic financial system can be efficiently solved by commercial software MATLAB.

Wiener process (i.e., Brownian motion) and the marked Poisson

process are introduced to model the continuous and discontin-

uous random fluctuations in real financial system (see Fig. 1).

More precisely speaking, a financial market, which refers to the

buy and sell behavior, can be described as a stochastic dynamical

financial system. Thus, the stochastic dynamical system can be

employed to describe the price changes of the objects of trans-

action (like stocks, bonds, futures, and oil ) or economic index

changes (investment rate, price index, and investment demand)

[36], [38]. One of the most famous stochastic financial systems

is the stochastic stock price system [36].

Let (, F , Ft , P) be a filtration probability space with F = {Ft : t  0}. F is generated by the following two mutually independent stochastic processes: 1) One-dimensional standard

Wiener process W (t); and 2) the marked Poisson processes

N (t; k ), for k = 1, 2, .., m, and the filtration Ft is also generated by -algebra of W (s) and -algebra of marked Poisson

processes N (s; k ), where k = 1, 2, .., m, for s < t.

turbance and denotes the external disturbance caused by the in-

ternational situation like war or natural disaster. Since 1-D stan-

dard Wiener process W(t) is a continuous but nondifferentiable

stochastic process, the term o (x(t))dW (t) can be regarded as

a continuous state-dependent internal random fluctuation, i.e.,

the financial system random fluctuation dependent on the cur-

rent magnitude of investment rate, price index, and investment demand; the term  = {1 , 2 , ..., m }  R1 is the mark space
of Poisson random processes and denotes the set of all minding

financial emergencial incidents, which will cause discontinuous

changes of the system in (3); the mark k denotes a financial

emergencial incident in the discussed financial system such as

financial tsunami, company merger, hot money inflow or the

collapse of bank; and the term o (x (t), k ) denotes a suddenly

violent change (the magnitude jump) at investment rate, price in-

dex, and investment demand of the stochastic financial system in

(3) when the financial emergencial incident happens. Thus, the

It is necessary to note that in this paper, we assume all the emer-

gencial incidents are mutually exclusive event (i.e., when the

jump occurs at time instant t, there is only one mark k to be

Some important properties of Poisson jump process are given

as follows [7]:

1) E {dN (t; k )} = k dt where the finite scalar number k > 0 is the Poisson jump intensity for mark k .
2) E {[dN (t; k )] dt} = 0, for all k. 3) E {[dN (t; k )] dW} = 0, for all k. 4) E {[dN (t; k1 )] [dN (t; k2 )]} = 0, for all k1 = k2 . 5) E {[dN (t; k1 )] [dN (t; k2 )]} = k1 dt, for all k1 = k2 . In fact, managers or investors always expect that the dynamic

behaviors of the invested financial system are satisfied with their

expectation. Thus, the multiobjective optimal control theories

are particularly suited for the multiobjective investment policy

problem of financial systems.

From the system diagram in Fig. 1, the regulation

purpose of stochastic financial system in (3) is to de-

sign regulation effort u(t) so that 1) the intrinsic ran-

be

by

the

stochastic financial system; 2) the effect of external disturbance

v (t) on the regulation performance of financial system should

be as small as possible, i.e., with a less risk; and 3) the desired

target xd could be finally achieved with a low cost. In order to regulate x(t) to the desired steady state (target)

xd , for the convenience of control design, the origin of nonlinear stochastic financial system in (3) should be shifted to xd

at first. In such a situation, if the shifted nonlinear stochastic

financial system is robustly stabilized at the origin, then the ro-

bust regulation of x (t) to the desired state(target) xd will be

equivalently achieved. This will simplify the regulation control

design procedure of the stochastic nonlinear financial system.

Let us denote

x~(t) = x(t) - xd .

(4)

Then, we get the following shifted nonlinear stochastic financial system in (3) as follows:

dx~(t) = (f (x~(t)) + Bu(t) + v(t)) dt +  (x~(t)) dW

m

+  (x~(t), k ) dN (t; k )

k=1

where f (x~(t)) = fo (x~(t) + xd ) ,  (x~(t)) = o (x~(t) + xd ), and  (x~(t), k ) = o (x~(t) + xd , k ).
Thus, the origin x~(t) = 0 of the nonlinear stochastic financial system in (5) is at the desired steady state (target) xd of the original nonlinear stochastic financial system in (3), i.e., the
investment policy problem of regulating nonlinear stochastic financial system in (3) to the desired xd is transformed to the stabilization problem of the shifted nonlinear stochastic finan-
cial system in (5). In order to achieve the desired state xd with less regulation
effort u(t) in spite of continuous and discontinuous random fluctuation, the H2 control performance J2 (u(t)) index for

the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion system in (5) without consideration of v(t) is defined as follows:

where Q1 > 0 and R1 > 0 are weighting matrices to tradeoff between regulation error x~ (t) and investment effort u(t).
To avoid the investment risk from the external disturbance, the H control performance index J(u (t)) of the nonlinear stochastic financial system in (5) is defined as follows:

J(u(t)) =

where Q2 > 0, R2 > 0, i.e., the worst-case effect from the exogenous disturbance v(t)  LF2 (R+ ; R3 ) to the regulation errors x~(t) and regulation effort u (t) from the average energy point of view. The H performance index J(u(t)) in (7) can be considered as the worst-case investment risk from external
disturbance. Since the external disturbance is unpredictable, the
worst-case effect of external disturbance is considered in the
investment risk.
In this study, from the system diagram of nonlinear stochas-
tic financial system in Fig. 1, we want to design a multiobjective H2 /H robust investment policy for system state x (t) to achieve a desired state xd from the perspective of minimum H2 regulation error with minimum investment effort u (t) in (6) and minimum H investment risk in (7) under intrinsic fluctuations and external disturbance. A more detailed design procedure of the multiobjective H2/H robust investment policy u (t) to simultaneously minimize J2 (u (t)) in (6) and J (u (t)) in (7) will be discussed in the following.

III. MULTIOBJECTIVE H2 /H INVESTMENT POLICY DESIGN FOR NONLINEAR STOCHASTIC FINANCIAL JUMP SYSTEM VIA
FUZZY INTERPOLATION METHOD
In general, construction of the multiobjective H2 /H regulation control for nonlinear stochastic system needs to solve an HJI-constrained MOP, which is difficult to be solved analytically or numerically. To overcome this difficult problem, the T­S fuzzy interpolation method is employed here to approximate the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system in (5). The T­S fuzzy dynamical model is proposed to approximate the nonlinear stochastic system in (5) by interpolating several local linearized stochastic jump diffusion financial systems around some operation points [17]­[20], [34], [39], [40]. This T­S fuzzified model is described by a group of IF­THEN rules and is used to simplify the multiobjective H2 /H investment policy design problem of the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system. The ith rule of this T­S fuzzy model for the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system in (5) is described by

financial system in (5). Similarly, the multiobjective H2/H investment policy
u (t) = K(x~ (t)) for the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system could be approximated by the following fuzzy
investment policy:

where hi(z) is designed as (11); Ki is the regulation gain for the ith fuzzy linearized system for i = 1, 2, . . . l.
The fuzzy parameters Ai, Ci, and Ei(k ) of l local linear financial systems in (11) can be easily identified by system identification toolbox in MATLAB. If adequate number of fuzzy rules is used in the T­S fuzzy system in (11), then the fuzzy approximation error could be considered as one kind of parametric fluctuations, and the proposed robust H2 /H multiobjective investment policy can efficiently override these parametric fluctuations due to fuzzy approximation. Therefore, the multiobjective H2 /H investment policy problem can be regarded as how to design fuzzy investment policy u(t) in (16) so that the T­S stochastic financial system in (11) could achieve the multiobjective H2 /H investment policy in (6) and (7).
A higher benefit investment behavior always couples with higher risk and higher capital cost. The optimal H2 regulation

in (6) expects the energy of regulation error x~ (t) and admissible investment policy u (t) as lower as possible, i.e., use a minimum capital to earn a desired benefit. However, for the robust H regulation design, a better (less) H performance index is always coupled with a higher capital cost to reject intrinsic continuous
and discontinuous fluctuation as well as external disturbance to achieve the desired target xd with a less risk. It is clear that the optimal H2 regulation design and robust H regulation design are mutually conflicted. Thus, designing a controller (investment policy) to optimize the H2 performance index J2 (u(t)) and the H performance index J(u (t)) is indeed a MOP of financial regulation systems. The definition of the multiobjec-
tive H2 /H investment policy for the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system is given as
Definition 1: The multiobjective H2 /H investment policy of a given nonlinear stochastic Poisson jump diffusion financial system (11) is to design an admissible investment policy u(t) in (16), which could make the H2 and H performance indices minimum in the Pareto optimal sense, simultaneously, i.e.

Then, the following theorems will provide the sufficient condition for the fuzzy investment policy u(t) in (16) to solve the multiobjective H2 /H investment policy problem for nonlinear stochastic jump financial system in (5). In the following,
according to two kinds of Poisson noise in stochastic financial systems, i.e., marked Poisson process N (t; k ) and marked compensation Poisson processes N^ (t; k ), the multiobjective H2/H investment policy problem will be solved separately in the following.

where U is the set of all the admissible investment policy for the given nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system; the objective functional J2(u (t)) and J(u (t)) are defined in (6) and (7), respectively; the vector of the objective functionals (J2 (u (t)), J(u (t))) is called objective vector of u (t).
Lemma 2 (see [35]): Suppose  and  are the upper bounds
of the H2 and H performance indices, respectively, i.e., J2(u (t))  , and J(u (t))  . The MOP in (17) is equivalent to the MOP given in the following:

Proof: The proof of this lemma is straightforward. One only needs to prove that both inequalities contained in the multiobjective problem in (18) become equal for Pareto optimal solutions. We will show this by contradiction. Given a 3-tuple Pareto optimal solution (u(t), , ) of MOP in (18), we assume that

1 <  and J2 (u(t)) = 1 . Now, for the same u(t), the solution (, ) dominates the Pareto optimal solution (, ), leading to a contradiction. This implies that both inequality constraints in MOP (18) indeed become equality for Pareto optimal solutions. The optimization problem in (18) is, hence, equivalent to the MOP described in (17).

The LMI-constrained MOP for the nonlinear stochastic financial system is concerned with evolution algorithm (EA). For the proposed LMI-constrained MOEA, the EA operates on a number of encoding feasible objective vectors called population so that for a feasible objective vector (k , k ), it should be encoded into a chromosome Ck . A feasible chromosome Ck is defined as a coded feasible objective vector. The chromosome of EA for the LMI-constrained MOEA employs the real-valued representation to avoid long binary string and large searching space in EA for the multiobjective H2 /H investment policy of the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system. In general, EA takes population to be the algorithm input and return the chromosomes with fitness performance to be the next population. The LMI-constraints in (20)­(22) to guarantee robust stability of financial system and the two upper bounds  and  are just like the environments in natural evolution. Only the adaptive chromosomes survive. For guaranteeing that all of these chromosomes can be decoded as the feasible objective vectors for the MOP in (19), each chromosome Ck should be examined by the existence of a feasible solution P k , K1k , .., Klk in LMIs in (20)­(22) with the LMI toolbox in MATLAB after mating operation. If some chromosomes are not feasible, these chromosomes need to be canceled from the candidate chromosomes. It is worth to mention that LMI constraints in (20)­(22) impose more restrictions on the searching of the feasible chromosomes than the conventional MOEA approach. Besides, using the LMI toolbox in MATLAB could help efficiently examine whether these chromosomes satisfy the LMIs in (20)­(22), which accelerates the selection speed of the initial populations via the initialization scheme.
Design procedure of multiobjective H2 /H investment policy of nonlinear stochastic financial systems: Step 1: Select the searching range (0 , 0 ) × (¯, ¯) for the
feasible objective vector (, ) and set the iteration number N¯ , the population number Np , the crossover ration Nc , and the mutation ratio Nm in the LMIconstrained MOEA.

Step 2: Select Np feasible chromosomes from the feasible

chromosome set randomly to be the initial population

P1 . Step 3: Set iteration index Ni = 1. Step 4: Operate the EA with the crossover ratio Nc , the mu-
tation ratio Nm , and generate 2Np number feasible

chromosomes by examining whether their correspond-

ing objective vectors are feasible objective vectors for

the LMIs in (20)­(22).

Step 5: Set the iteration index Ni = Ni + 1 and select Np chromosomes from the 2Np feasible chromosomes in

Step 4 through nondominated sorting method to be the

Step 6:

population PNi . Repeat Steps 4 and

5

until

the

iteration

is

reached. If the iteration number N¯ is satisfied, then we

set PNi = PF . Step 7: Select a "preferable" feasible objective individual
,   PF according to designer own preference.
Once the "preferable" feasible objective individual is

selected, the corresponding Pareto optimal solution

V. SIMULATION RESULTS
To illustrate the design procedure and to confirm the performance of the proposed optimal investment policy for nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system, we introduce a nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system to mimic an emerging market in (2). In general, an emerging market always suffer from continuous and discontinuous intrinsic random fluctuations due to national and international situation change, oil price change, the surplus between investment and saving, the variable of interest rate, etc. The external investment disturbance is caused by the unpredictable investment changes or worldwide events such as war, nature disaster, fatal epidemic, etc.

Fig. 3 is used to describe the dynamical behaviors of the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system in (2) with much fluctuations in real situation. It is seen that the three states x(t), y(t), and z(t) of the nonlinear stochastic financial system fluctuate with random jumps. Therefore, the multiobjective H2/H investment policy of the MOP in (17) is employed by the government to design an investment policy to regulate the stochastic financial system to achieve the following desired steady state:

xd = (0.1, 4.5, - 0.2)

(53)

i.e., the government of emerging market expects its financial
system to be regulated to achieve a desired financial steady state with interest rate 0.1, investment demand 4.5, and price index -0.2 to coordinate inflation rate, supply and demand in the emerging market to stimulate the recovery of emerging market
under continuous and discontinuous random fluctuation.
In this example, we assume the vector of premise variables z = [x1 (t), x2 (t)]T = [z1 (t), z2 (t)]T in (11) and (16) is available in the regulation design. Since there are eight fuzzy sets associated with premise variable z1(t) and eight fuzzy sets associated with premise variable z2(t), totally there are 64 fuzzy IF­THEN rules, in the T­S fuzzy financial system. The operation

Based on the proposed design procedure of the multiobjective H2 /H optimal investment policy, the MOEA algorithm is employed to solve the MOP in (19). In the MOEA algorithm, the searching region  is set as  = [0 70] × [0.4 1.2], the maximum number of individuals Np = 80, iteration number Ni = 100, crossover rate Nc = 0.8, and mutation ratio Nm = 0.2.
Once the iteration number N¯ = 100 is achieved, the Pareto front PF for the Pareto optimal solutions of the MOP for the investment policy of the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system of the emerging market in (5) or (11) can be obtained as shown in Fig. 4.
In order to illustrate how to select the preferable solution of the investment policy, we choose three Pareto optimal solutions from the Pareto front for comparison, whose Pareto objective vectors are given in Table I. Moreover, in Figs. 5­7, the simulation results of the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system for the emerging market are given to illustrate the performance of the multiobjective H2/H optimal fuzzy investment policy of the three chosen Pareto optimal solutions for the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system in (5) or (11). The corresponding P matrices in (20) of the three chosen Pareto solutions are also given in Table II. In Figs. 5­ 7, the Pareto optimal solution 1 has the best J performance

However, for the Pareto optimal solution 3, it has the minimum J2 performance index, but its trajectory has the maximum perturbation of the three because it has the maximum J performance index. It is easy to observe that Pareto solution 2 is the preferable regulation solution of the three chosen Pareto solutions because the

VI. CONCLUSION
This study has investigated the multiobjective H2 /H investment policy for nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial systems via the T­S fuzzy model interpolation method. Unlike the most multiobjective problems only focusing on algebraic systems by the indirect method in Lemma 2, the proposed multiobjective H2 /H investment policy could solve the optimal robustness and regulation problems of a nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial system to achieve a desired target with a less risk and a less regulation investment effort, simultaneously. To avoid solving nonlinear system dynamic-constrained MOP, the T­S fuzzy model interpolation method is employed such that the nonlinear system dynamic constraints can be replaced by two sets of LMI constraints. If there exist some feasible solutions for the LMI constraints in (20)­(22), the LMI-constrained MOP could be solved easier by the proposed LMI-constrained MOEA algorithm. Thus, the multiobjective H2/H investment policy for nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial systems can be solved efficiently by the help of the commercial software MATLAB via LMI toolbox. When the Pareto front is obtained for Pareto optimal solutions of the MOP in (19), the manager can select a preferable fuzzy investment policy from the set of Pareto optimal fuzzy investment policy according to his/her own preference and finish the multiobjective H2 /H investment policy design of the nonlinear stochastic financial system. Finally, an example is given to confirm the satisfactory performance of the proposed multiobjective H2 /H investment policy design for nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial systems through the computer simulation.
