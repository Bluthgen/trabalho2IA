Data-Driven Stochastic Pricing and Application to Electricity Market
Saahil Shenoy, Senior Member, IEEE, and Dimitry Gorinevsky, Fellow, IEEE

Abstract--This paper develops a novel approach to computation of the probability integrals encountered in derivative pricing using stochastic models estimated from historical data. First, nonparametric probability distribution models are built directly from the data as a solution of a convex optimization problem scalable to very big datasets. Second, these models are used for numerical calculus of probability integrals, where the quadrature includes long tails of the probability distributions. The application example is the procurement contract in the day-ahead bulk market for electricity. The data for PJM utility loads and prices in the dayahead and spot markets were used to estimate the risk and to price the contract. The data-driven forward contract pricing allows to optimize the contract cost and reduce it by 2% compared to the baseline; this corresponds to about $0.6B/year in potential utility savings.

I. INTRODUCTION
T HIS paper presents a data-driven probability integral method for pricing fixed-term derivative contracts. The motivating problem is described next but the method is potentially applicable to many other derivative pricing problems. We consider a load serving entity (LSE), such as an electrical distribution utility, that holds a service obligation to supply electricity at the predetermined hour without restriction on volume (a load following contract). In the day-ahead forward contract, the LSE procures the forecasted amount of the electricity from the wholesale day-ahead market and faces the opportunity cost of procuring an unknown remaining amount at the contract delivery time in a volatile spot market.
The stated problem has special features that call for use of modern signal processing methods, see [1]. First, the electrical load and the spot prices are non-Gaussian random variables. Their distributions are conditional on the known regressor vari-

ables and often have long tails. Second, this is a fixed term problem, which allows to use data-driven models trained on historical data for the past fixed term periods. Third, the stochastic pricing problem involves two interdependent random variables: the electricity load and the spot price. The electricity load influence means the contract cannot be priced by arbitrage relative to the spot price.
The established derivative pricing approaches, such as the celebrated Black­Scholes model, assume normal distributions of the variables, see [2]. Most derivative pricing approaches for the electricity market use normal distribution models as well, e.g., see [3]­[5].
Closer to the subject of this paper is work on fixed term derivatives, starting from [6], [7], where nonparametric models of distributions can be estimated directly from the historical data. In [8], [9], nonparametric models are used for pricing electricity forward contracts.
The cited work does not include nonparametric modeling of conditional distributions with many regressor variables. The electricity markets are more predictable than stock markets. This allows using more complex models with regressors including seasonal variables (monthly, weekly, intra-day hour), weather variables, and others. An approach known as quantile regression (QR) is well suited for modeling of such nonparametric distributions, see [10]­[13]. The QR distribution models have been used for derivative pricing, e.g., see [14] and [15]. The QR models have been also used for electricity data forecasting, see [16]­[18]. The QR models are applied to risk estimation in [13], [19]­[21].
Most of the related prior QR work uses kernel regressors, e.g., see [22]­[27]. The finite-support or Gaussian kernels cannot model the long tails of the probability distribution.
Long tail models have been long used in the actuarial science approaches to insurance, see [28]­[30]. The use of the long tail model in finance has increased in the recent years, e.g., see [31]­[34]. With the proliferation of variable wind and solar generation, the probability distributions in the electricity market are increasingly non-Gaussian. However, the only prior work using QR models with long tails in electricity market applications known to the authors is [16].
The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, it develops QR non-parametric models of the probability distributions based on historical data and including long tails. Second, these models are extended to two interdependent variables: the electrical load and the spot price. Third, the paper shows how to use the developed models for numerical computation of stochastic integrals in the derivative pricing. Finally, it demonstrates applications of the methodology to the motivating example of the load following contracts in the electricity market.

Sections III-A through III-E of this paper are based on the earlier conference papers [35], [36].

II. PROBLEM FORMULATION

We consider the dataset

D = {yP,i , y ,i , Zi }iN=1 ,

(1)

where scalars yP,i and y,i are response variables, vectors Zi  n are explanatory variables (regressors), i is the sample number, and N is the number of the samples.
In the motivating problem of the forward contract pricing, variable yP,i describes the amount of the electricity to be procured in the contract. Variable y,i describes the future spot price of the electricity at the delivery time. In what follows, we assume that data (1) are i.i.d., and follow unknown conditional multivariate distribution yP , y |Z. In forecasting applications, i is the time sample and the i.i.d. assumption means the underlying process is stationary.
The stochastic pricing requires to estimate the multivariate probability density p(yP , y |Z). This distribution is used to compute a stochastic integral of the form

E[f (yP , y )] =


f (yP , y )p(yP , y |Z)dyP dy . (2)
-

We consider the class of probability integrals (2) for the functions of the form

f (yP , y ) = (y ) · (A(yP ) - B)+ ,

(3)

where the notation (·)+ = max(·, 0) is used; (·) and (·) are two monotonically increasing functions; (·) is unbounded. Such integrals are often encountered in derivative pricing, e.g.,
for spread options, see [37].
Let y be the solution to (y) = B/A; for the unbounded monotonically increasing function , the solution always exists.
The full stochastic integral (2), (3) is now approximated as

E[f (yP , y )] = A · (y|, ) - B · (y|, 1), (4)



(y; (·), (·)) =

(y )(yP )

- y

p(yP , y |Z)dyP dy ,

(5)

where the dependence on the definite integral  on the integrand functions  and  has been made explicit. The term (y|, 1) in (4) means that the integral is computed for (yP ) = 1. The computation of integral (5) for specific functions  and  is discussed in Section IV-B.
For special case of (·) = 1, integral (2), (3) is encountered in the stochastic calculus of pricing options. If we take , (·) = 1, A = 1, and (·) = exp(·) in (3), then f (yP , y ) = (eyP - B)+ gives pricing of a European call option for the log-price variable yP and strike price B. If, further, yP follows a Gaussian distribution, we get the celebrated Black­Scholes model [2]. Most of the existing work related to derivatives pricing assumes Gaussian distributions of the prices.
This paper extends the stochastic integral (2) to a general non-parametric probability distribution model. Such model of the joint probability distribution for the amount and the price

can be acquired directly from the data. The paper estimates the non-parametric model and uses it for computing (2).
Fig. 1 overviews the proposed methodology for stochastic pricing. First, historical data is used for model estimation. The obtained distribution model is then used in Stochastic Pricing to compute Contract Pricing (2).
The next sections describe the detail of the approach. The model estimation is discussed in Section III. Computation of stochastic pricing (2) is discussed in Section IV. Section V demonstrates example applications related to the electricity market.

III. ESTIMATING THE PROBABILISTIC MODEL
The distribution p(yP , y |Z) in (2) is modeled from data (1) using multiple QR. The non-parametric model provides a flexible description of the distribution shape. The constructed model can be then used in the stochastic integral. This section describes the proposed data-driven modeling method.

A. Single Quantile Regression

As a starting point, consider a special case of the dataset D (1) with one scalar dependent variable yi.

Dqr = {Zi , yi }iN=1 ,

(6)

where vectors Zi are the same as in (1). It is assumed the data (6) are i.i.d. and follow an unknown conditional multivariate distribution with the probability density function p(y|Zi). We are trying to estimate the probability density p(y|Zi) from data (6) .
We assume that the distribution p(y|Z) for (6) is described by the following QR model

P (y  y(q)|Z) = q,

(7)

y(q) = Z(q) + (q),

(8)

where q  (0, 1) is the quantile level;   n and   are the QR hyperplane parameters.
For a given q, model (7) can be estimated by solving a LP (linear programming) problem, see [38]. This LP problem can be compactly written as

minimize h(Y - Z - 1N ; q),
,

h(Y ; q) = 2

(9)

where vector Y = [y1 . . . yN ]T  N ×1 , matrix Z = [Z1 . . . ZN ]T  N ×n , and 1N  N is a column vector of ones. In the case of q = 1/2, QR is the well-known median regression.
Quantile regression (9) uses pinball loss function h(Y ; q) and

(OLS) regression with squared loss

Y

.

The QR can be used for estimation of the entire generating

distribution in (6). The distribution can be estimated through a

non-parametric model of the cumulative density function

P(y|Z) in (7). The predictive power of such non-parametric

model estimated using QR is limited by two issues. The first is-

sue is that if there are few data points on one side of the quantile

hyperplane, solution (9) might have very large variance. This

issue is with the distribution tails: the left tail quantile levels

q 1 and the right tail quantile levels, 1 - q 1. This issue

is discussed below in Section III-E.

The second issue is that the QR hyperplanes for different

quantiles are generally not parallel to each other. This means

they intersect, at which point the estimated quantiles loose their

ordering. This is known as the quantile crossing problem. The

issue of the quantile crossing is discussed in Section III-D.

B. Multiple Quantile Regression

We need a model of the form (7), where  = (q) and  = (q) are smooth functions that can be differentiated to compute the probability density. Solving individual QR problems (9) for many different values q might not give the desired result. To get a better solution, we solve a multiple QR problem on the grid of m quantiles qj

0 < q1 < . . . < qm < 1.

(10)

These multiple QR problems are solved as a joint optimization problem with a smoothing penalty

where h(Y, q), Y , Z, and 1N are defined in (9);  is a penalty on the first difference on j ; , on the second difference of j . The reasoning behind the introduction of the smoothing penalties and selection of parameters  and  is presented in Section III-D. The constraints on j in (11) are introduced because for the low and the high quantiles there is not enough data on one side of the
hyperplane to get accurate estimates of both regression slope j and its intercept j . The tail modeling is further discussed in Section III-E.

C. Solving the Multiple Quantile Regression
Convex optimization problem (11) is a quadratic programming (QP) problem. For small to moderate problem size, it can be solved with many available QP solvers. Large problem

sizes for large training data sets (6) and large dimension of the regressor vector Z require a specialized convex optimization approach. The large problem sizes are encountered in the practical applications of the described QR modeling methods. A scalable approach to solving problem (11) is discussed in our paper [35], where more detail can be found. This convex optimization problem can be solved by using the block splitting formulation of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) [39]. The ADMM solution is scalable and parallelizable in the number of data points and the number of regressors. It has been demonstrated for N = 21 696 data points with 4455 decision parameters in [35]. For a problem with N = 106 data points and 105 decision parameters the solution took 15 minutes to compute on a quad-core PC.

D. Quantile Crossing Problem

The quantile crossing issue is brought up in the end of Section

III-A. It is examined here in more depth.

The multi-quantile model is obtained by solving (11). The

solution is the set of the slopes j and intercepts j (11) on

the quantile grid (10). This set describes the functions (q) and

(q) in (7).

The probability density p(y) =

dq dy

can be obtained

by differentiating y = Z + . In practice, a secant method of

differentiation can be employed using j and j .

The quantile crossing is avoided if

to

where M is a preconditioner matrix. Consider the regressor scatter matrix ZT Z, where Z = [Z1 . . . ZN ], for data set (6). Preconditioner M can be selected such that the matrix M -1 (ZT Z)M -1 is well conditioned.
Consider the following use case. Model (7) is estimated (trained) for a set of past data (6). It is then exploited in some on-line algorithm for new data points. Will quantile crossing be an issue? The quantile hyperplanes intersect somewhere in the regressor space, unless (q) is constant. This means one can always find a regressor Z such that model has quantile crossing.
Below is a sufficient condition that there is no quantile crossing for a given regressor Z. Taking matrix norms of ZM -1 and the remaining multiplier in (13), maximizing over q, and dividing by the second norm yields

computed on the grid (10) to evaluate  in (15). The smoothing parameters  and  in (11) should be tuned such that condition (14), holds for all (or almost all) data points. The numerical analysis of these quantile crossing conditions and of the smoothing parameter tuning for the problem closely related to the examples in Section V can be found in [35].

E. Tail Modeling

The described smoothed QR model (7), (8), (10), (11) interpolates the available data. The distribution tails, i.e., the extreme values of response variables y have to be modeled separately. The stochastic model for the last (or the first) quantile can be extrapolated beyond the data range if its parametric form is known. Extreme value theory (EVT) predicts that in many cases the distribution tails follow a Pareto (power law) or exponential distribution [40]. The EVT methods for tail estimation are peaks over threshold (POT) and the block maxima. This paper uses the POT method because it employs all data in the last (or the first) quantile.
The application examples of Section V, use log-variables. In log-coordinates, the Pareto distribution becomes an exponential distribution. The exponential tails can be estimated as a separate step, after the solution to (11) has been computed. The first qL = q1 and the last qR = qm quantile levels on the quantile grid in (10) are used as the tail thresholds. The POT exceedances are

eL,j = yj - Zj 1 - 1 , j  JL ,

(16)

eR,k = yk - Zk m - m , k  JR ,

(17)

where JL  {j : yj < Zj 1 + 1 } and JR  {k : yk > Zk m + m }.
We assume the tail probability distributions to be

Z1 + 1 - y|y < Z1 + 1  Exp(L ), (18) y - Zm - m |y > Zm + m  Exp(R ). (19)

These distributions are conditional on the POT exceedance events in (18) and (19), which have probabilities qL = P(y < Z1 + 1 ) and qR = P(y < Zm + m ). The Maximum Likelihood Estimates of the tail rate parameters L in (18) and R in (19) are

L-1 = -mean(eL,j |j  JL ),

(20)

R-1 = mean(eR,k |k  JR ).

(21)

F. Quantile Model of the Distribution
The numerical calculation of the stochastic integral (2) requires expressing the probability density p(y|Z) through the data-driven probabilistic model of the form (7), (8), (10), (11), (18), (19).
Model (7) defines the cumulative density function (CDF): P (y  y(q)|Z) = Fy|Z (y) = q. Model (8) can be then considered as the inverse CDF (quantile function) y = Fy-|Z1 (q), where q is the quantile level.
The QR model (8), (11) is estimated at the quantile grid points (10). We extended this model to the entire (0, 1) quantile interval

as

m

y(s|Z) = (Zj + j )Kj (s),

(22)

j=1

where kernel functions Kj (s) are such that Kj (qj ) = 1, and Kj (qk ) = 0 for k = j. Model (22) does linear interpolation between the grid nodes (10) and extrapolation for the tails in accordance with (18), (19). We use

Kj (s) = Bj,2 (s)

for qL  s  qR , (23)

(25)

where Bj,2 (s) are the second-order (triangular) B-spline kernels with knots (10). The log terms in (24) and (25) come from the quantile functions (inverse CDFs) of the tail exponential distributions (18) and (19).

G. Bivariate Distribution in Quantile Variables
The bivariate distribution p(yP , y |Z) in (2) can be expressed using the conditional probability formula

p(yP , y |Z) = p(y |Z, yP ) · p(yP |Z).

(26)

We model p(y |Z, yP ) and p(yP |Z) through the respective inverse CDFs of the form (22)­(25). The inverse CDF model for p(yP |Z) can be expressed as

m

yP (s|Z) = (ZP,j + P,j )Kj (s),

(27)

j=1

where the model parameters for yP , such as P,j and P,j , are obtained according to (8), (10), (11), (18), (19).
The inverse CDF model for p(y |Z, yP ) in (26) explicitly depends on yP , which is an additional regressor parameter. Similar to quantile model (27), we have
m
y (r|Z, yP ) = (Z ,j +  ,j yP +  ,j )Kj (r). (28)
j=1

IV. NUMERICAL STOCHASTIC INTEGRATION
This section presents a method for numerical computation of the stochastic integral (5) using the nonparametric probability distribution model of the form (27), (28). In this section the regression variable vector Z is given and fixed. Therefore, the explicit dependence on Z is omitted to make the explanation clearer.

A. Probability Integral Transform
Models (27), (28) expressed in terms of the quantile levels allow to formulate integral (5) using the probability integral transform. The joint pdf in (5) can be expressed through quantile

B. Numerical Integration Approach
The evaluation of (q) in (5) is illustrated in Table I that shows partitioning of the 2-D [0, 1] × [0, 1] integration domain into nine subdomains. The double integral (q) is a sum of the integrals over these subdomains, which are annotated in Table I.
The middle block in Table I does not include singularities and can be computed using numerical quadrature. For simplicity, assume that the same uniform quantile grid of the form (10) is used for building both models (27) and (28), where qj - qj-1 =

q. The quadrature using linear interpolation (trapezoidal rule) is, then (assuming that q < qR )

For q  qR , we have (q) = 0. When computing integral (4), special care should be taken
of the distribution tails that correspond to the eight edge blocks in Table I. Functions  (27) and  (28) include logarithms at the integration domain edges that have singularities at 0 and 1 respectively. These logarithmic singularities describe the quantile behavior of the exponential distribution tails. Because of the singularities, the integrals for all eight edge blocks in Table I are not amenable to the numerical quadrature and must be computed analytically. The obtained analytical expressions for the eight edge block integrals given below can be used in the numerical computation of integral (4). Each of the eight tail integrals depends on the tail behaviors for the two the integration variables, q and r, and on the inner integral limit q in (34).
The tail integrals for the eight edge blocks can be expressed through the following auxiliary functions

V. APPLICATION EXAMPLES
The motivating example for this paper is the stochastic pricing of the day-ahead electricity procurement contracts entered by a distribution utility. We consider the following stylized problem. The distribution utility is buying electrical power at the advance bulk electricity market. This happens every midnight, when the utility enters into 24 forward contracts for each hour of the next 24-hour day. As the day goes on, at each hour, the utility must fulfill the aggregate demand of the retail customers. This power load demand is unknown in advance. Possible shortages of the forward contract are filled by procuring the deficit amount at the spot electrical power market, which can be rather volatile. If the forward contract provides a surplus of the power, the overpayment cannot be recovered.
This section applies the developed methodology to a few problems related to the described day-ahead electricity procurement setup. Section V-A applies the modeling approach of Section III to data sets for a major US utility, PJM. The result is the data-driven stochastic models for the power loads and spot prices. The obtained models allow using the numerical stochastic pricing approach of Section IV for the forward contract pricing. As a simple example of the method usage, Section V-C evaluates the risk of the forward contract in fulfilling the power load demand. Section V-D provides forward contract pricing for a given hour of the day. This contract pricing is then applied to demonstrate procurement policy optimization in Section V-E.

A. Model for Day-Ahead Forward Contract
Let Pt be the load demand and t the spot price at hour t. The response variables yP,t and y,t in the dataset (1) are indexed by the number of hours t elapsed since the start of the data collection and are

yP,t = log (Pt /P0 ) ,

where the log-load is normalized by P0 = 1 GW and the logprice by 0 = $1/MWh. Regressors Zt in (66), (67) include 6 indicators for week days, 11 for calendar months, and 3 for holidays, as well as 24-hour lagged log-load and log-spot price for a total of 23 regressors. For more discussion on the regressors see [35], [36].
This work uses a data set from the PJM utility, which is described in [41], [42]. The total system load Pt is used in the examples below. The range of the loads is 51 to 158 GW, with the average load of 88 GW. The data covers a time range from January 2011 to December 2013 with sampling interval of one hour, N = 26 280 samples at all. The dataset also includes the spot electricity prices. The prices range from $0/MWh to $768/MWh, with the average around $37/MWh. The price is sampled at an hourly rate, the same as the load. We split up the dataset into two parts, the training and test set. The training set includes the data from January 2011 to December 2012, the total of 17 520 samples. It is used to estimate the data-driven stochastic models of Section III for the log power loads and log spot prices. The test set from January 2013 to December

2013, which contains 8760 time samples, is used for validating the model Section V-B and the model-based policies in Sections V-C and V-E.
The data-driven methods of Section III were applied to estimate two probabilistic models from the data: the model of the form (27) for the log load yP,t (66) and the model (28) for the log price y,t (67). The models use quantile grid (10) with m = 99 and spacing q = 0.01 spanning from qL = rL = 0.01 to qR = rR = 0.99.
Selection of smoothing parameters  and  is discussed in Section III-D. More detail on parameter tuning for a closely related application example can be found in [35]. In both data fit problems (11), for (66) and (67), the smoothing parameters were set to  = 5 · 105 ,  = 5 · 105 for 2, 3, and 6-hour ahead forecasts and  = 106 ,  = 5 · 105 for all other hours. Cross validation of these parameters based on Pearson's chi square test statistics is discussed in Section V-B.
Fig. 2 illustrates overall modeling logic. The model training is based on Data Set (6), which is the input into the optimal fit of smoothed QR procedure (11). The output is distribution model on quantile grid (10) described by quantile regression parameters {j , j }mj=1 in (11), and tail rate parameters (20) and (21).
The fit of the estimated models (27), (28) is illustrated by using them for forecasting the data in the training dataset. Overall, 24 models of the form (27) for the log loads at each of the 24 hours of the next day were estimated along with the 24 models of the form (28) for the log prices. At each midnight point, forecasts for the next 24 hours were computed and then compared to the actually realized values.
Fig. 3 illustrates the load forecasts for a 101 hour segment (just over 4 days) computed for quantile levels q = 0.1, 0.5, 0.9 in the models of the form (27), (66). The 24 hourly forecasts for the 24 trained models are stitched together in the figure. The actual load demand curve is plotted along with the quantile level forecasts.
Fig. 4 illustrates the quantile forecasts for the spot prices. The format is the same as in Fig. 3.

Fig. 5. Joint distribution histogram.
B. Statistical Validation of the Model
After the probability integral transform (31), the original distribution (26) becomes a uniform distribution in [0, 1] × [0, 1] square in the quantile variables (q, r), see [43]. Following [43], [44], the statistical validation of the estimate of distribution (26) is equivalent to testing the uniform distribution hypothesis in the transformed variables (q, r). This is done by dividing the [0, 1] × [0, 1] square into 100 cells of 0.1 × 0.1 size. Each cell has a probability mass of 0.01.
Fig. 5 shows percentages of the test set data points in the 100 quantile cells for the estimated 20-hours ahead forecast model. As expected, the results are around 1% (the average of 3.65 data points). The Pearson's chi-squared test of the goodness of fit can be computed for the binned data in Fig. 5 with 99 degrees of freedom, e.g., see [43], [44]. The test does not reject the uniform distribution hypothesis with significance of 99%.
The chi-squared test results for all estimated models are shown in Fig. 6. The dashed line shows the 99% critical value of the distribution. The bars show the chi-squared statistics for the 24 forecast hours. They are all below the dashed line, which means the null hypothesis holds. These are results for the test set with the model estimated from the training set. The chi-squared statistics for the training set are substantially smaller.

Figs. 5 and 6 characterize the goodness of fit of models (27) and (28) for the distribution body. The distribution tails describe rare extreme events that are not seen in these figures and not covered by the tests. The exponential model fit for the right tails of quantile functions (27) and (28) in log-variables (66), (67) is illustrated by the QQ plots in Fig. 7. The errors of the 8am (8-hour ahead) forecast for the training set are plotted. The QQ plots show that the tail models fit the data very well. These logexponential (Pareto) models have the best fit by far compared to the alternatives. More discussion on selecting and estimating tail distribution models for electrical load and price data, as well as further references can be found in [33], [35], [45].

C. Forward Contract Risk Estimation
The models built in Section V-A can be used for estimating the risk of the forward contract for electricity delivery. The probabilistic evaluation of risk is important because load volatility is increasing with the on-going proliferation of the renewable generation. The most important risk factor is that the required amount of the electricity cannot be procured at the spot market, because the stand-by generation capacity is insufficient.
Consider a stylized formulation, which resembles empirical approach used by some ISOs (independent systems operators) for operational provisioning of the generating capacity, see [46]. Assume that power amount in the day-ahead electricity procurement contract is determined by utility using the OLS forecast of the form similar to (8)

y^P,t = Zt OLS + OLS ,

(68)

The ISO ensures that the generation capacity for the power procured by the utility is available with a 10% operating reserve margin. If the actual demand exceeds the operating reserve, it cannot be fully satisfied, no matter the price. This means some hard load must be shed, which is called a loss of load (LOL) event. The risk of the LOL events is controlled by the regulator, NERC. The LOL expectation is required to be less than of 1 day in 10 years, which corresponds to LOL probability (LOLP) of less than 0.00027.
In accordance with (66), the reserved capacity is Pt = 1.1 · P0 exp(y^P,t ). The risk of the LOL event is Rt = P(yP,t > log 1.1 + y^P,t |Zt ). It can be estimated using formula (4) and stochastic integral (5), where (r, q) = 1, (q) = 1, A = 1, B = 0, and y = log 1.1 + y^P,t . The parts of integral (34) shown in Table I can be computed in accordance with (35), (42)­(45), and (46)­(49), (52), (53), where  = 1 is obtained by setting  = 0 in (50) and  = 1 for  = 0 in (51). Alternatively, the risk Rt can be obtained from the numerical quantile model yP (s|Z) (27); Rt = 1 - st , where st is a solution to yP (st |Zt ) = log 1.1 + y^P,t .
To illustrate the risk estimation, 24 risk values are computed at each midnight for the 24 OLS forecasts for each hour of the next day. Forecast for each hour is using its own OLS model (68), (69) for the log loads yP . The model is trained based on the data set described in Section V-A. The risk estimates for 24 hours of each day in the training dataset have been stitched together to provide coverage for each hour of the data. Fig. 8 shows risk Rt computed for a 101 hour (about 4-day) segment of the data. The minimum of the risk estimate is less than 10-5 and mostly less than 0.01. This means evaluation of the risk relies on the tail part of the data-driven probabilistic model of Section V-A. The horizontal dashed line in Fig. 8 is the LOLP = 0.00027 mandated by NERC. One can see that the common approach of using the OLS forecast plus 10% margin does not provide the required LOLP at all times. Fig. 8 shows that using the OLS forecast provides average log-risk that looks reasonable; however the average risk is much higher than the required LOLP.

SHENOY AND GORINEVSKY: DATA-DRIVEN STOCHASTIC PRICING AND APPLICATION TO ELECTRICITY MARKET

1037

An alternative approach is to use the data-driven probabilistic
model (27), (28) described in Section V-A to achieve the risk
Rt = r = 0.00027 at all times by using QR forecast y^P,t = yP (r|Zt ). This risk corresponds to the horizontal dashed line in Fig. 8.

D. Forward Contract Pricing
In this section, the data-driven probabilistic model of Section V-A is used for forward pricing of the electricity procurement contract.
We consider the day-ahead forward contract entered at the midnight for the electricity delivery at given hour t of the next day. With the regressor vector Zt known, the conditional quantile models of the form yP (q) (27) for log-load (66) and of the form y (r) (28) for the log-prices (67) can be used. The quantile model (27) and inverse of (66) can be used to parametrize the advance power order Pa (t) though a quantile level variable s as Pa (t) = P0 eyP (s). Note that s  Pa (t) is a one-to-one transformation since both (27) and (66) are monotonic functions.
The forward contract cost Ct depends on the future log-load yP,t and log-spot price y,t , which are both random variables. Its expectation can be expressed as

+
To compute expected forward contract cost (70), we need to evaluate stochastic integral (2) with exponential functions (50), (51) in integrand function f (yP,t , y,t ) (3). Integral (70) is obtained by setting A = P0 , B = P0 eyP (s) in (3) and  =  = 1 in (50), (51). We then used formulas (4) and (5). The parts of integral (34) shown in Table I were evaluated in accordance with (35), (42)­(45), (46)­(49), (52), (53).

E. Contract Cost Optimization

The forward contract pricing in Section V-D can be used as a basis for optimizing the procurement policy. This section considers optimization of the total expected cost that is the sum of the advance cost and the expected forward contract price. These costs depend on the advance power order Pa (t).
The advance cost is the deterministic value adv,t-1 Pa (t). Using the same quantile parametrization as in Section V-D, we have

At (s) = adv,t-1 P0 eyP , t (s) ,

(71)

where adv,t is the advance price at time t. The advance price data from PJM utility is described in [42]. The advance prices range between $0/MWh and $313/MWh, with the average of $37/MWh.
The total cost Tt (s) at a given time t is

Tt (s) = At (s) + E[Ct (s)],

(72)

where the expected forward contract cost E[Ct (s)] (70) is computed as the stochastic integral, see Section V-D. Based on (71), the advance cost At (s) is a non-decreasing function of s. The expected spot cost E[Ct (s)] is a non-increasing positive function of s. The optimal trade-off between the advance cost and

Fig. 10. Backtesting logic.

the spot cost that minimizes total cost Tt(s) (72) can be found numerically by computing Tt (s) on a grid of quantile levels s  (0, 1).
Fig. 9 illustrates the total cost Tt(s) for 12 pm on July 19, 2013 computed from E[Ct (s)] (70), At(s) (71), and (72) on the grid of the quantile levels s. Its minimum is achieved near so = 0.81. For s < so , Tt (s) is dominated by E[Ct (s)] and for s > s, by At (s).
In backtesting, the historical data ahead in time of the contract
allows computing the actual realized cost for an advance logpower procurement y¯P,t as

Ut (y¯P ,t ) = adv,t P0 ey¯P , t + t P0 eyP , t - ey¯P , t +

(73)

where yP,t is the actual log power load that realized at the contract exercise time. We compute the actual realized cost Ut for the procured log power y¯P,t = yP (so (t)), where so (t) minimizes the total cost Tt (s) in (72). We compare it with the results for the baseline advance procurement policy y¯P,t = y^P,t that is based on the OLS forecast (68), (69). The comparison of these two actual realized costs is summarized in Table II. The optimized actual realized cost Ut (yP (so )) shows 1.11% savings, which is $153,000 for the chosen hour.
We backtest the optimized procurement policy y¯P,t = yP (so (t)) and the baseline OLS forecast procurement policy y¯P,t = y^P,t . The two actual realized costs (73) are computed for each hour of the test set (the year of 2013). Fig. 10 illustrates the backtesting logic.

The backtesting results are shown in Fig. 11 for a selected 61 hour period (about 1.5 days). It can be seen that most of the time the optimized policy has lower cost than the OLS forecast policy. Fig. 11 shows that main savings come at the peak load times. This is because the developed non-parametric model describes the tails much more accurately than the normal distribution model implied in the OLS. The full year actual cost results are summarized in Table III. The yearly savings are 2.08% or $641 million for the utility.
VI. CONCLUSION
This paper has developed a numerical stochastic pricing method for forward procurement contracts using non-parametric long tail probabilistic models acquired directly from historical data. The method has been demonstrated in application to electricity procurement in day-ahead bulk markets. One example is risk estimation, another example is forward contract pricing and optimization. Backtesting of the optimized policy based on the developed data-driven method using electric utility data has demonstrated savings of 2.08% or $641 million.
