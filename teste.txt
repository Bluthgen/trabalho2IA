IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL. 25, NO. 2, APRIL 2017315FN-TOPSIS: Fuzzy Networks for RankingTraded EquitiesAbdul Malek Yaakob, Antoaneta Serguieva, Senior Member, IEEE, and Alexander Gegov, Member, IEEEAbstract—Fuzzy systems consisting of networked rule bases,called fuzzy networks, capture various types of imprecision inher-ent in ﬁnancial data and in the decision-making processes on them.This paper introduces a novel extension of the technique for order-ing of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methodand uses fuzzy networks to solve multicriteria decision-makingproblems where both beneﬁt and cost criteria are presented assubsystems. Thus, the decision maker evaluates the performanceof each alternative for portfolio optimization and further observesthe performance for both beneﬁt and cost criteria. This approachimproves signiﬁcantly the transparency of the TOPSIS methods,while ensuring high effectiveness in comparison with establishedapproaches. The proposed method is further tested to solve theproblem of selection/ranking of traded equity covering developedand emergent ﬁnancial markets. The ranking produced by themethod is validated using Spearman rho rank correlation. Basedon the case study, the proposed method outperforms the existingTOPSIS approaches in terms of ranking performance.Index Terms—Fuzzy networks (FNs), multicriteria decisionmaking (MCDM), portfolio selection, ranking performance, Spear-man rho correlation, technique for ordering of preference by simi-larity to ideal solution, type 1 fuzzy numbers, type 2 fuzzy numbers,Z-numbers.I. INTRODUCTIONM ULTICRITERIA decision-making (MCDM) problemsare often observed in reality, and decision makers (DMs)are faced with the challenge of the presence of multiple criteria.The focus is on identifying the best performing solution amongfeasible alternatives assessed by a group of DMs and evaluatedthrough multiple criteria [1]. In portfolio optimization, investorstarget high returns and affordable risks. Typically, assets withthe potential for high returns also carry a high market risk [2].Structuring complex problems well and considering multiplecriteria explicitly lead to more informed and better decisions.There have been important advances in the ﬁeld since the startof the modern MCDM discipline in the early 1960s. VariousMCDM techniques have been developed with the overall ob-jective to assist DMs solve complex decision problems in asystematic, consistent, and more productive way.Manuscript received August 3, 2015; revised December 4, 2015; acceptedFebruary 11, 2016.

The TOPSIS analysis considers two ref-erence points—a positive ideal solution (PIS) and a negativeideal solution (NIS)—as well as the distances to both PIS andNIS. The preference order is ranked according to the closenessof PIS and NIS, and according to a combination of the twodistance measures. TOPSIS is considered as one of the majordecision-making techniques and, in recent years, has been ef-fectively applied to the areas of human resource management[3], transportation [4], product design [5], manufacturing [6],water management [7], quality control [8], military [9], tourism[10], food science [11], and location analysis [12].TOPSIS is used in this research due to its stability and sim-plicity of use with cardinal information [13]. TOPSIS has beensuccessfully applied in MCDM problems as one of the mostfrequent methods used. The main advantage of the TOPSISmethods is that they are easily implemented and understood, asthey directly deﬁne values based on experts’ opinions in orderto calculate ﬁnal results [14].Fuzzy TOPSIS was introduced to approach uncertainty inlinguistic judgment. Initial research on fuzzy TOPSIS was con-ducted in [15], where TOPSIS is extended to type-1 fuzzy en-vironments; this extended version used type-1 fuzzy linguisticvalue (represented by type-1 fuzzy number [16]) as a substitutefor the directly given crisp value in grade assessment. Overall,the type-1 fuzzy TOPSIS problem is to ﬁnd the most desirablealternative(s) from a set of n feasible alternatives, according tothe decision information by DMs about attribute weights andattribute values. There is no solution satisfying all attributes si-multaneously, as attributes are conﬂicting to some extent. Thus,the solution is a set of noninferior solutions, or a compromise so-lution according to the DM’s preferences [17]. However, the ex-isting fuzzy MCDM methods are only based on type-1 fuzzy sets[18]. In order to offer better care for the problems of vagueness,another discovery, type-2 fuzzy set was provided by Mendel,John, and Liu [19]. This concept looks to comprehensively rep-resent uncertainties, compared with type 1 fuzzy set, due to theability of providing more ﬂexible spaces [18].Zadeh introduced the concept of type-2 fuzzy set [20], whichis a generalization of the concept of fuzzy set. This concept isillustrated by a fuzzy membership function, where each elementof this set is a fuzzy set in [0, 1], unlike a type-1 fuzzy set wherethe membership grade is a crisp number in [0, 1] [21]. Themembership functions of type 2 fuzzy set are 3-D and includea footprint of uncertainty (FOU) as the new third dimension,which can be described as the union of the primary member-1063-6706 © 2016 IEEE.

The FOU provides additional degrees of freedom todirectly model and process uncertainties, and type-2 fuzzy setis more comprehensive compared with fuzzy set in providingmore ﬂexibility spaces to represent uncertainties [23]. The chal-lenges in computational volume have led to the development ofinterval type-2 fuzzy set in 2000 by Mendel and Liang [24]. Itcan be viewed as a special case, as all values of secondary mem-bership are equal to 1 [25]. Currently, interval type-2 fuzzy set iswidely used and successfully applied in perceptual computing[26], [27], control systems [28]–[31], and the MCDM ﬁeld. Oneof the MCDM methods incorporating interval type 2 fuzzy setis the interval type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS (T2-TOPSIS), which wasﬁrst established in [18]. The authors introduced a T2-TOPSISmethod to approach fuzzy MCDM problems.Most recently, Z-number has been the newest fuzzy numberpresented in the literature of fuzzy sets. Z-number is introducedin [32] as an extension of type-1 fuzzy number but is completelydifferent from type-2 fuzzy number. Although both Z -numberand type-2 fuzzy number are extensions of type-1 fuzzy num-ber, the former is capable of measuring the reliability of thedecision made while the latter is not. Since fuzzy numbers arethe medium of quantitative representation for natural language,Z- number enhances the capability of both type-1 and type-2fuzzy numbers by taking into account the reliability of the num-bers used [32]. According to [33], Z-number is represented bytwo embedded type-1 fuzzy numbers, where one of them playsthe role to deﬁne the reliability of the ﬁrst one. Research on uti-lizing Z-number in decision-making applications is inadequateas compared with other fuzzy numbers, as it is a new concept de-veloped in the theory of fuzzy sets. One of the MCDM methodsthat implemented Z-number is called Z-TOPSIS and was ﬁrstestablished in [34]. The authors presented a Z-TOPSIS methodto handle fuzzy MCDM problems, in order to give a mean-ingful structure for formalizing information in decision-makingproblems, as it takes into account DMs’ reliability. Z-numberuncertainty relates to fuzziness of class boundaries. Possibil-ity theory is rooted in uncertainty of type-1; however, over theyears, possibility theory has moved in the direction of extendingits domain to accommodate uncertainty of type-2 [35].Fuzzy systems are vital within the armory of fuzzy toolsand applicable to real-life decision-making environments. Thereare three types of fuzzy systems introduced in the literature:systems with a single rule base, systems with multiple rulebases, and systems with networked rule bases. Systems with asingle rule base are characterized with a black box nature, wherethe inputs are mapped directly to the output without consideringany internal connection. Systems with multiple rule bases arecharacterized with a white box nature, where the inputs aremapped to the outputs through interval variables as connections.This type of systems is also termed chained fuzzy systems orhierarchical fuzzy systems. The third type of fuzzy systemsincorporates networked rule bases and is termed fuzzy networks(FN). FNs are introduced as a theoretical concept in [36] andare characterized with a white box nature, where the inputs aremapped to the outputs through intermediate variables.According to [37], the accuracy of single rule base is moder-ate, but the level of transparency is low, while multiple rulebases are regarded as having low accuracy in dealing withcomplex process management. While in most decision-makingstudies, single rule bases and multiple rule bases are commonapproaches [38], in this research, we focus on FNs as they areboth well transparent and accurate. A node represents each sub-system in an FN, whereby the interactions among subsystemsare the connections between nodes. Therefore, FNs consider ex-plicitly the interaction among subsystems [37]. An FN is moretransparent than a single-rule-based fuzzy system for decisionmaking because it considers separately beneﬁt-related and cost-related criteria. This network takes into account explicitly theinternal structure of the modeled process by representing eachgroup of criteria as a node and the interactions among differ-ent groups as connections. This network-based approach allowsthe modeled process to be presented as a white box in contrastwith the existing system-based approaches that use a black-boxpresentation. In this case, the white-box presentation improvessigniﬁcantly the transparency of the model due to the explicitand adequate reﬂection of the internal structure of the modeledprocess. This ability brings considerable beneﬁts to modelingcomplex processes, and although FNs have been introducedrecently, a signiﬁcant volume of work has been done and ded-icated to the theoretical development and applications of FNs[36], [37], [39], [40].On the other hand, the reliability of decision informationand the experience of experts are still in need of better in-corporation into modeling complex decision-making processes.For example, how conﬁdent in their choices are investors asDMs, and how much experience experts as ﬁnancial analystshave in relevant asset classes and markets [41]. Furthermore,existing TOPSIS methods have a very low transparency leveland, therefore, are not able to track the performance of ben-eﬁt and cost criteria [42]. In decision-making processes, it isimportant that DMs are aware of how the multiple criteria areperforming. Based on [43], in a decision-making environment,it is essential to track the performance of criteria, in order totake control and not underestimate or overestimate uncertaintyof the criteria. The proposed method represents a systematicTOPSIS approach to estimating the strengths and weaknessesof alternatives that satisfy transactions, activities, or functionalrequirements for a business. In addition to that, tracking of crite-ria allows DMs to determine if it is a sound investment/decision(justiﬁcation/feasibility) and provides a basis for comparing al-ternatives. In this case, it involves comparing the total expectedcost criteria of each alternative against the total expected beneﬁtcriteria, to see whether the beneﬁts outweigh the costs and byhow much. The inefﬁciencies described above bring the moti-vation of this study.This paper proposes a novel FN-based modeling method thatrepresents an extension of fuzzy set theory. The method hasbeen validated comparatively against established fuzzy-system-based modeling methods for a case study on ranking tradedequities. The main advantages of the proposed method in thecontext of this case study are its higher transparency and ac-curacy. This paper is structured as follows. Section II brieﬂyreviews the concepts of fuzzy sets and fuzzy systems, and theoperation of FNs. The novel methodology of TOPSIS using FNswith merging rule base FN-TOPSIS is formulated in Section III.Section IV illustrates the application of FN-TOPSIS to theYAAKOB et al.: FN-TOPSIS: FUZZY NETWORKS FOR RANKING TRADED EQUITIES317problem of ranking equities traded on the major stock exchangesin a developed and a developing ﬁnancial market. Further dis-cussion and analysis of the FN-TOPSIS ranking performanceare provided in Section V. The main conclusions are summa-rized in Section VI.II. THEORETICAL PRELIMINARIESA. Fuzzy SetsDeﬁnition 1 (Type-1 fuzzy sets) [20]: A type-1 fuzzy set Ais deﬁned on a universe X and is denoted asA = {(x, μA (x))|x ∈ X}where μA (x) : X → [0, 1] is the membership function of A.The membership μA (x) describes the degree of belonging-ness of x ∈ X in A. Throughout this paper, type-1 and type-2fuzzy numbers and Z-numbers are presented through trape-zoidal membership functions. The good coverage of trapezoidalmembership functions is a good compromise between efﬁciencyand effectiveness.Deﬁnition 2 (Type-1 fuzzy numbers) [44]: A trapezoidaltype-1 fuzzy number is represented by the following member-ship function:μA (x) = (a1, a2, a3, a4) =⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩x − a1a2 − a11,a4 − xa4 − a30,,,if a1 ≤ x ≤ a2if a2 ≤ x ≤ a3if a3 ≤ x ≤ a4otherwise.Deﬁnition 3 (Type-2 fuzzy sets) [19]: A type-2 fuzzy set ˜Ain the universe of discourse X is represented by a type-2 mem-bership function μ ˜A as follows:˜A = {((x, u) , μ ˜A(x, u) ≤ 1}where JX denotes an interval in [0, 1]. A type-2 fuzzy set ˜A canalso be represented as(x, u))|∀u∈JX ⊆ [0, 1] , 0≤μ ˜A˜A =where JX ⊆ [0, 1] andx and u.(cid:6)(cid:6)x∈X(cid:7)(cid:7)(x, u)μ ˜A(x, u)u∈J xdenotes the union over all admissible1 , aUaU2 , aU(cid:8)˜AL4 ; μ13 , aU(cid:8)˜AL(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)Deﬁnition 4 (Interval type-2 fuzzy numbers) [19]: A trape-zoidal interval type-2 fuzzy number is represented by˜A =˜AU , ˜AL˜AU, μ2(cid:8)(cid:8)=(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:8)˜AU,, μ2and2 , aL3 , aLaL1 , aL˜AU4 ; μ1˜AL are type-1 fuzzy numbers, whilewhereaU1 , aU2 , aU3 , aU4 , aL1 , aL2 , aL3 , and aL4 are the reference points ofthe interval type-2 fuzzy number ˜A. In addition, μj ( ˜AU ) de-notes the membership value of the element aU(j+1) in the up-per trapezoidal membership function ˜AU for 1 ≤ j ≤ 2, andμj ( ˜AL ) denotes the membership value of the lower trapezoidalmembership function ˜AL for 1 ≤ j ≤ 2. Here, μ1(AU ) ∈ [0, 1],μ2(AU ) ∈ [0, 1], μ1(AL ) ∈ [0, 1], and μ2(AL ) ∈ [0, 1], for 1 ≤i ≤ n.Deﬁnition 5 (Z-numbers) [32]: Z-number is an ordered pairof type-1 fuzzy numbers denoted as Z = ( ˜A, ˜B). The ﬁrst com-ponent ˜A, a restriction on the values, is a real-valued uncertainvariable. The second component ˜B is a measure of reliabilityfor the ﬁrst component.The concept of a Z-number Z = ( ˜A, ˜B) provides a basis forcomputation with fuzzy numbers that have various reliabilities.The second component ˜B may be interpreted as a response tothe question: How conﬁdent are DMs that ˜X is ˜A.B. Fuzzy SystemsA fuzzy system consists of a single rule base where inputsare processed simultaneously without taking into account theconnections and the structure of the system. For this type ofsystem, the rules are derived based on expert knowledge aboutthe process. The results are normally quite accurate, but the poortransparency of the system can be an obstacle to understandingcomplex processes.C. Fuzzy NetworksAn FN is a new type of fuzzy system, which consists of net-worked rule bases (nodes) and deals with inputs sequentially,while taking into account the connections and structure of thesystem. The rules for both fuzzy systems and FNs are derivedfrom knowledge and data. A networked fuzzy system is trans-parent and fairly accurate at the same time due to its hybridnature, which facilitates the understanding and management ofcomplex processes.There are four formal models for FNs characterized in [36],namely: 1) IF–THEN rule and integer tables; 2) block schemesand topological expressions; 3) incidence and adjacency ma-trices; and 4) Boolean matrices and binary relations. Here, weRule 1 : If is S11 and ··· and pm is Sm 1, then q1 is T11and··· and ql is Tn1.........Rule r : If is S1r and ··· and pm is Sm r , then q1 is T1r and··· and ql is Tn r .(1)318IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL. 25, NO. 2, APRIL 2017employ IF–THEN rules and Boolean matrices, in order to repre-sent the fuzzy rules. Hence, the properties of such models willbe reviewed brieﬂy. The choice is justiﬁed by the ability of theseformal models to work with any number of nodes in FNs.A fuzzy system with r rules, m inputs p1, . . . , pmtaking linguistic terms from the sets {s11, . . . , s1r}, . . . ,{sm 1, . . . , sm r}, and n outputs q1, . . . , qn taking linguisticterms from the output sets {T11, . . . , T1r}, . . . ,{Tn1, . . . , Tn r},can be described by the following rule base from (1), as shownat the bottom of the previous page.A rule base is incorporated as a node within the FN. A gen-eralized Boolean matrix compresses information from a rulebase represented by a node. The row and column labels of theBoolean matrix are all possible permutation of linguistics termsof the inputs and outputs for this rule base. The elements of theBoolean matrix are either “0”s or “1”s, where each “1” reﬂectsa present rule. The Boolean matrix representation of the rulebase from (1) is given asS11 ··· Sm 1S1r ··· Sm r...T11 ··· Tn1 ··· T1r ··· Tn r1...0···...···0...1.(2)Boolean matrices are very suitable for formal representationof FNs [40]. They describe FNs at a lower level of abstrac-tion with respect to individual nodes. Boolean matrices alsolend themselves easily to manipulation for the purpose of sim-plifying FNs to linguistically equivalent fuzzy systems, usingthe linguistics composition approach. In the next subsection,we brieﬂy review two Boolean matrix operations, as these twoare involved in the FN-TOPSIS.Basic operations: Horizontal merging is a binary operationthat can be applied to a pair of sequential nodes in FN. Thisoperation combines the operand nodes from the pair into a singleproduct node. The operation can be applied when the outputfrom the ﬁrst node is fed forward as an input to the secondnode in the form of an intermediate variable. The product nodehas the input from ﬁrst operand node and the output from thesecond operand node, whereas the intermediate variable doesnot appear in the product node.Fig. 1. Horizontal merging of nodes.Therefore, if the ﬁrst operand node is the rule base in (1)that is represented by the Boolean matrix in (2), and the secondoperand node is the rule base in (3), shown at the bottom ofthe page, that is represented by the generalized Boolean matrixin (4), see (3):Then, the generalized Boolean matrix of (3) is described asR11 ··· Rg1 ··· R1r ··· Rg rT11 ··· Tn1T1r ··· Tn rS11 ··· Sm 1S1r ··· Sm r......1...01...0···...······...···0...10...1The product node is the rule base in (5), as shown at thebottom of the page, and its generalized Boolean matrix of (5) isconstructed asR11 ··· Rg1 ··· R1r ··· Rg r.(4).(6)The fuzzy system described by the rule base in (3) iswith r rules, n inputs q1, . . . , qn taking linguistic terms fromthe input sets {T11, . . . , T1r}, . . . ,{Tn1, . . . , Tn r}, and g out-puts w1, . . . , wg taking linguistic terms from the set of out-puts {R11, . . . , R1r}, . . . ,{Rg1, . . . , Rg r}. Similarly, the fuzzysystem described by the rule base in (5) is with r rules,m inputs p1, . . . , pm taking linguistic terms from the in-put sets {S11, . . . , S1r}, . . . ,{Sm 1, . . . , Sm r}, and g outputsw1, . . . , wg taking linguistic terms from the set of outputs{R11, . . . , R1r}, . . . ,{Rg1, . . . , Rg r}. In general, the operandrule bases may have a different number of rules, but the numberof rules in the product rule base is always equal to the number ofrules in the ﬁrst operand rule base. For simplicity, the notationsused in Fig. 1 are in a vector form where the vectors x, y, and vare of dimensions n, m, and g, respectively.Rule 1 : If q1 is T11 and··· and qm is Tn1, then w1 is R11and··· and wg is Rg1......Ruler : If q1 is T1r and ··· and qm is Tn r , then w1 is R1r and ··· and wg is Rg r .Rule 1 : If p1 is S11 and ··· and pm is Sm 1, then w1 is R11and ··· and wg is Rg1......Rule r : If p1 is S1r and ··· and pm is Sm r , then w1 is R1r and ··· and wg is Rg r......(3)(5)YAAKOB et al.: FN-TOPSIS: FUZZY NETWORKS FOR RANKING TRADED EQUITIES319Vertical merging is a binary operation that can be applied toa pair of parallel nodes in an FN. The inputs to the product noderepresent the union of the inputs to the operand nodes, and theoutputs from the product node represent the union of the outputfrom the operand nodes.Therefore, if the ﬁrst operand node is the rule base in (1)that is represented by the Boolean matrix in (2), and the secondoperand is the rule base in (7), shown at the bottom of the page,that is represented by the generalized Boolean matrix in (8):then the generalized Boolean matrix of (8) is described with(9):R11 ··· Rg1R1r ··· Rg s...Q11 ··· Qh1 ··· Q1s ··· Qhs1...0···...···0...1.(8)The product node is the rule in the following equation:Rule 1 : If p1 is S11 and ··· and pg is Sm 1 w1is R11 and ··· and wg is Rg1 then q1 is and ··· andqn is Tn1 and y1 is Q11 and ··· and yh is......Rule r · s :is R1s and ··· and wg is Rg s then q1 is T1r and··· and qn is Tn r and y1 is Q1s and ··· and yh is QhsIf p1 is S1r and ··· and pm is Sm r and w1...(9)and the generalized Boolean matrix of (9) is constructed asT11 ··· Tn1Q11 ··· Qh11...0··· T1r ··· Tn rQ1s ··· Qhs···...···0...1S11 ··· Sm 1R11 ··· Rg1S1r ··· Sm rRg r ··· Rg s....(10)In this case, the fuzzy system described by the rule basein (8) has s rules, g inputs w1, . . . , wg taking linguistic termsfrom the input sets {R11, . . . , R1s}, . . . ,{Rg1, . . . , Rg s}, andh outputs y1, . . . , yh taking linguistic terms from the output sets{Q11 ··· Q1s}, . . . ,{Qh1 ··· Qhs}.

Forsimplicity, the notations used in Fig. 2 are in a vector form, wherethe vectors x, y, v, and w have dimensions n, m, g, and h, re-spectively.III. METHOD FORMULATIONIn this approach, the DMs’ opinions are evaluated indepen-dently, since they may have different inﬂuence degrees, de-pending on their experience in the area. Furthermore, criteriaare categorized into beneﬁt criteria or cost criteria. Each cat-egory generates correspondingly beneﬁt fuzzy systems or costfuzzy systems, where the output of the systems is beneﬁt levels(BLs) or cost levels (CLs), representing the performance of eachcategory.

Z-Number ImplementationFor the Z-number implementation of TOPSIS-FN, Tables I–III from Section III-A are used, with an additional Table VIIfor the linguistic terms representing DM reliability.Here, the reliability of experts is taken into considerationduring the decision-making process. The experts are advised touse the linguistic terms in Table VII to evaluate the conﬁdencein their decision. DMs are not supposed to use negative weightto represent their opinion. Otherwise, this would imply the useof unreliable information, which is undesirable. This applies atthe start of step 1 of the algorithm described in type-1 fuzzynumber implementation of FN-TOPSIS. The other steps are thesame as the implementation discussed in Section III-A.Step 1: Use the information from Table VII to derive thesecond component B of the Z-number, and then, convert theZ-number to type-1 fuzzy number.)|x ∈Let Z = ( ˜A, ˜B) is a Z-number, where { ˜A = (x, μ ˜A[0, 1]},{ ˜B = (x, μ ˜B)|x ∈ [0, 1]}, and μ ˜A and μ ˜B are trape-zoidal membership functions. The second part (reliability) needs325(44)to convert into a crisp number using fuzzy expectation, as(cid:7)(cid:7)α =xμ ˜B dxμ ˜B dx(cid:7)wheredenotes an algebraic integration. Then, add the weightof the second part (reliability) to the ﬁrst part (restriction).Weighted Z-numbers can be denoted as˜Z α = {(x, μ ˜A α )|μ ˜A α (x) = αμ ˜A(x) , x ∈ [0, 1]} .These can be represented with type-1 fuzzy numbers as, x ∈ [0, 1](cid:9) =< x, μ ˜Z α (x) > |μ ˜Z α (x) = μ ˜A(.˜Z’x√α !(cid:9)It is proven in [33] that ˜Zhas the same fuzzy expectationas ˜Z α . The remaining steps of the algorithm are the same asfor the type-1 fuzzy sets implementation. The next section sys-tematically illustrates the application of type-1 fuzzy sets of theproposed FN-TOPSIS method to solve the problem of selec-tion/ranking of traded equity.IV. RANKING OF TRADED EQUITYWe study the problem of ranking traded equity in developingﬁnancial markets within a crisis period, in order to illustrate theapplicability and validity of the proposed FN methodology in arealistic scenario. DMs with different levels of experience eval-uate 25 equities listed on the main board of the Kuala LumpurStock Exchange (KLSE) on November 30, 2007. A set of ﬁ-nancial ratios for the equities are considered toward the beneﬁtand cost criteria in the FN-TOPSIS algorithm. These include thefollowing: 1) Market value of ﬁrm (B1), deﬁned as market valueof ﬁrm-to-earnings before amortization, interest, and taxes. Thisis one of the critical ﬁnancial indicators, and the lower the ra-tio, the better the equity [46]. 2) Return on equity (ROE) (B2),which evaluates how much the company earns on the investmentof its shareholders. ROE is measured as net income divided bystockholder funds. Portfolio managers examine ROE when de-ciding whether to trade (buy or sell) equities. The higher valuesof the ratio indicate healthier companies. 3) Debt-to-equity ratio(C1), belonging to long-term solvency ratios that are intendedto address the ﬁrm’s long run ability to meet its obligations. Itis considered by DMs that the lower the ratio, the better [47].4) Current ratio (B3), which measures liquidity of companiesand explains the ability of a business to meet its current obli-gations when fall due. The higher the ratio, the more liquid isthe company and, therefore, in a better position.[48]. 5) Marketvalue-to-net sales (B4) is market value ratios of particular inter-est to investors. The lower the ratio, the better the equity [49].The lower this ratio is, the better the equity. 6) Price/earningsratio (C2) measures the ratio of market price of each share ofcommon stock to the earnings per share, the lower this ratio, thebetter.In this study, the processes of ranking equities follow the pro-posed methods in Section III. Fig. 4 illustrates the FN model forthe problem of selection/ranking of traded equity and includesfour beneﬁt criteria and two cost criteria.326IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL. 25, NO. 2, APRIL 2017and to produce overallΔB +1,1 =4(cid:22)ΔB +1(cid:30)vi1,1, v+i,1(cid:31)= 0.11 + 0.409 + 0.668i=1+ 0.298 = 1.4841.Next, using (14) for j = 1 and k = 1, the distance between−1 is calculated asE1 according to DM1 and the FPIS A1(v11 ,1 , vΔB −−1 ,1 ) =similarly, ΔB−0.789, and ΔB−4(cid:22)24ΔB−1,1 =)13[(0.81 − 0)2 + ··· + (1 − 0)2 ] = 1.373;−−2,1) = 1.063 , ΔB−(v21,1, v3,1) =(v31,1, v−4,1) = 1.242, producing overall(v41,1, v3(cid:30)ΔB−1vi1,1, v−i,1(cid:31)= 1.373 + 1.063 + 0.789i=1+ 1.242 = 4.4671.j,k and ΔC −Now, the distances ΔC +j,k between the rating ac-cording to DM k of cost criteria i = 1, . . . , 2 for each equity j−+(j = 1, . . . , 25) and the FPIS Ak or FNIS Ak are calculatedusing (15) and (16).

ANALYSIS OF RESULTSFor the validation of the proposed rule-based FN-TOPSIS, theauthors consider established TOPSIS methods, as the nonfuzzyTOPSIS [13] and the nonrule-based fuzzy TOPSIS approaches:T1-TOPSIS [15], T2-TOPSIS [18], and Z-TOPSIS [34]. Allthese methods are applied to evaluate the ﬁnal ranking of theequities as shown in Table IX, based on case study in Section IVand compared with the performance of FN-TOPSIS. The actualmonthly equity returns in November 2007, based on tradingthe shares of the 25 companies on the KLSE and holding for amonth, are used for benchmarking. The rankings are comparedusing the Spearman rho correlation coefﬁcient ρ, where ρ mea-sures the strength of association between two ranked variables.This comparison approach is intuitively interpretable and lesssensitive to bias due to the effect of outliers [50]. The Spear-man’s Rank coefﬁcient is evaluated asρ = 1 − 6 (cid:21)∂2n3 − n(52)iwhere ∂i represents the difference between the ranks, and n isthe number of considered alternatives.The coefﬁcient ρ takes values between +1 and –1. Perfectpositive relationship of ranks is indicated with ρ = 1, and ρ =−1 indicates perfect negative association of ranks, while ρ = 0shows no relationship.Considering the criteria set used, i.e., B1, B2, B3, B4, C1,and C2 of traded equity described in Section IV, the threeproposed FN TOPSIS methods (PM) outperform the four es-tablished TOPSIS methods (EM), as shown in the last rowof Table X.VI. CONCLUSIONThis paperintroduces a novel TOPSIS method—FN-TOPSIS—extending the capabilities of rule-based FNs withinMCDM analysis. FN-TOPSIS uses type-1, type-2, and Z-fuzzynumbers and incorporates experts’ knowledge into decisionanalysis as well as experts’ degree of experience and inﬂu-ence. At the same time, the approach improves transparencyof decision analysis, particularly, in the TOPSIS process, byexplicitly taking into account all subsystems and interactionsamong them. FN-TOPSIS not only provides an effective way toprocess imperfect information in decision-making practice in amore ﬂexible and intelligent manner, but also presents expertknowledge more accurately. The performance of the proposedmethod is validated using a benchmark and comparing againsta set of competitive approaches. The results show that the pro-posed method outperforms the existing nonrule-based TOPSISmethods in terms of ranking performance. We have successfullyapplied FN-TOPSIS to the problem of ranking equities traded ina developing ﬁnancial market during a crisis period. This studycontinues research on hybrid approaches, implementing fuzzyset theory in equity ranking and investment decisions, in a de-veloped market (U.K.) during a precrisis period [51]–[54]. Thenext objective is to implement and analyze the performance ofthe approach within developing and developed ﬁnancial marketsduring a postcrisis period.REFERENCES[1] A. Hadi-Vencheh and M.
